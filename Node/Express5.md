# Express.js 5 vs Express 4: A Practical Upgrade Tutorial

Express 5 is a long-awaited update to the popular Node.js framework, arriving almost a decade after Express 4. It brings many incremental improvements without radically changing the core API. In this tutorial, we’ll explore the key advantages of Express 5 over Express 4, with side-by-side examples and migration tips for experienced Node.js developers. We’ll cover new features like promise-based route handling, router enhancements, updated error handling, and the removal of old APIs – and explain how these changes improve code quality, performance, and developer experience.

## Overview of What’s New in Express 5

Express 5 focuses on modernizing and streamlining the framework after years of stability on v4. Some highlights include:

- **First-class Async/Await Support:** You can use promise-based middleware and route handlers without extra libraries. Express 5 will catch rejected promises or thrown errors from `async` functions and pass them to error handlers automatically ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=,middleware%20and%20handlers)).
- **Enhanced Routing & Router:** The routing layer is updated for more explicit path patterns and security. New path parameter syntax (e.g. named wildcards and optional segments with braces) replaces some old practices ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=,longer%20supported%2C%20use%20braces%20instead)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=1.%20%60%3Aname%3F%60%20becomes%20%60,specific%20things%20in%20previous%20versions)). This makes route definitions clearer and avoids regex-related pitfalls.
- **Improved Error Handling:** Error handling is more robust. For example, server startup errors are handled in `app.listen` callbacks (instead of throwing) ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)), and the framework’s default behaviors better propagate errors from asynchronous code.
- **Cleanup of Deprecated APIs:** Express 5 removes or replaces many deprecated methods from Express 4, resulting in a cleaner, more consistent API ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,res.status%28status%29.json%28obj)). Legacy functions like `app.del()`, `req.param()`, and ambiguous response methods are gone in favor of modern alternatives.
- **Modernized Core:** Express 5 requires Node.js 18+, allowing it to leverage modern JavaScript (ES6+ features) and improve performance ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=Express,js%20projects)) ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=1)). Built-in middleware (like body parsers) are updated, with support for new tech like Brotli compression ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)).

In the sections below, we dive deeper into each of these improvements with examples of how to migrate code from Express 4 to Express 5.

## 1. First-Class Async/Await (Promise-Based Middleware & Routes)

One of the most developer-friendly enhancements in Express 5 is **native support for promises and async/await in route handlers and middleware**. In Express 4, using `async` functions required manual try/catch logic or third-party helpers to handle errors. In Express 5, any error thrown in an async route or any rejected promise returned by a handler will be **automatically forwarded to Express’s error-handling middleware** ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=,middleware%20and%20handlers)).

**Express 4 Example (Async Route with Manual Error Handling):**

```js
// Express 4
app.get('/data', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const result = await fetchFromDB();
    res.send(result);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);  // had to manually pass the error to error middleware
  }
});
```

**Express 5 Example (Async Route with Automatic Error Handling):**

```js
// Express 5
app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await fetchFromDB();
  res.send(result);
}); // any error thrown here is automatically caught and routed to error handlers
```

In Express 5, we simply remove the try/catch. If `fetchFromDB()` throws or returns a rejected promise, Express will catch it and invoke the error handler as if we called `next(err)` ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=)) ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=%7D%20catch%20%28err%29%20)). This significantly reduces boilerplate and potential mistakes. It allows you to focus on your business logic rather than plumbing error handling in every route. The improvement also applies to middleware functions: an `async` middleware can `throw` an error (or let a promise reject) and Express will handle it.

**Why this improves developer experience:** It simplifies error management for asynchronous code. In Express 4, forgetting to catch an error in an async handler could crash the app or result in unhandled promise rejections. Express 5’s approach makes route code cleaner and less error-prone ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=Rejected%20promises%20are%20automatically%20passed,functions)). You no longer need wrappers like `express-async-handler` or manual `next(err)` calls – the framework itself deals with it, improving code quality and reliability.

> **Note:** Best practice is still to handle expected errors close to where they occur when appropriate. But Express 5’s promise support ensures any uncaught exceptions in async code won’t be swallowed – they’ll go to your error handling middleware by default ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=)).

## 2. Enhanced Routing and Path Parameters in Express 5

Express 5 introduces some changes to routing syntax, mainly to make route definitions more explicit and secure. The framework upgraded its route matching engine (using an updated `path-to-regexp` library) and in doing so changed how certain route patterns are defined ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=Changes%20to%20path%20matching%20and,regular%20expressions)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,oh%20my)). Here are the key differences:

- **Named Wildcard Routes:** In Express 4, you might use `*` as a wildcard to match “anything” in a path. In Express 5, the `*` wildcard must be given a name (often called a “splat”). For example:
  - **Express 4:** `app.get('/*', handler)` – matches any path after root.
  - **Express 5:** `app.get('/*splat', handler)` – you need to name the wildcard (here “splat”) and can access it as `req.params.splat` ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=,splat%60%20instead%20of)).
  
  If you want the wildcard to also match an empty path (root), you can wrap it in braces: `app.get('/{*splat}', handler)` ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=Note)). This small change makes it clear that a route parameter is being captured, rather than using an unnamed catch-all.

- **Optional Path Segments:** Express 4 allowed a question mark (`?`) to denote an optional parameter or extension in the route string. Express 5 no longer supports the standalone `?` in route strings. Instead, it uses a clearer syntax with braces `{ }` to denote optional parts of a path ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=,longer%20supported%2C%20use%20braces%20instead)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=1.%20%60%3Aname%3F%60%20becomes%20%60,specific%20things%20in%20previous%20versions)). For example:
  - **Express 4:** `app.get('/files/:name.:ext?', handler)` – the `.ext` part is optional.
  - **Express 5:** `app.get('/files/:name{.:ext}', handler)` – the portion inside `{ }` (including the dot) is optional.

  You can even make **multiple segments optional**. Express 5 allows optional groups, which means you can avoid writing separate routes for cases with or without a segment. For instance, you could define a route like `app.get('/base{/:sub}/:id', handler)` to handle both `/base/:id` and `/base/:sub/:id` in one declaration ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=removal%20of%20regular%20expression%20semantics,how%20you%20write%20your%20routes)). This was not possible in Express 4 without workarounds or duplicate route definitions.

- **No Unescaped RegEx in Route Strings:** Express 5 removed support for regex patterns embedded directly in route strings (known as “sub-expression” regex). For security reasons (to prevent ReDoS attacks), patterns like `/user/:id(\\d+)` are no longer allowed ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=)). In Express 4, you might have written `app.get('/item/:itemId(\\d+)', ...)` to only match numeric IDs. In Express 5, you must instead use a parameter and then validate it in handler code or use an array of paths for alternatives. **All route parameters must be named** now – you cannot rely on regex capture groups to populate `req.params[0]` etc. Every `:` parameter in the path yields a named value ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=This%20release%20no%20longer%20supports,ordered%20numerical%20parameters)).

  *Migrating tip:* If you had complex regex in your routes, migrate by either:
  - Replacing them with multiple route definitions or param options. For example, Express 4 route `/post/:lang(en|fr)/:id` could become two routes: `/post/en/:id` and `/post/fr/:id`, or use a middleware to validate `:lang`.
  - Use validation inside the handler (e.g. check `req.params.id` with a regex) rather than in the route string.

- **Reserved Characters:** Characters like `(`, `)`, `?`, `+`, `*`, `[` and `]` are now reserved in route strings (unless escaped) ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=means%20you%20can%20now%20do,specific%20things%20in%20previous%20versions)). This is mostly relevant during migration – if your Express 4 routes contained these symbols thinking they’d be literal, Express 5 might interpret them differently or throw errors. Make sure to escape special chars (with a backslash) or adjust the syntax as per the new rules.

**Example – Wildcard and Optional Route Migration:**

```js
// Express 4: wildcard route for any path under /docs
app.get('/docs/*', (req, res) => { 
  res.send('Docs catch-all');
});

// Express 5: wildcard must be named
app.get('/docs/*rest', (req, res) => {
  // req.params.rest contains the remaining path
  res.send('Docs catch-all');
});

// Express 4: optional category prefix (allowed "category" to be optional)
app.get('/posts/:category?/:postId', getPost);
// (could match "/posts/42" or "/posts/tech/42")

// Express 5: optional segment using braces
app.get('/posts{/:category}/:postId', getPost);
```

In the above, the Express 5 route `'/posts{/:category}/:postId'` cleanly covers both URLs with and without a category. This syntax reduces the need for multiple route definitions and makes optional parts explicit. Overall, the routing changes in Express 5 encourage **more clarity and security** in how routes are defined, which improves maintainability. The new patterns also eliminate ambiguous cases and potential regex vulnerabilities ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=This%20release%20no%20longer%20supports,hook%20for%20such%20security%20aspects)).

## 3. Improved Error Handling and Stability

Express 5 includes some under-the-hood tweaks to error handling that enhance stability and give developers more control:

- **Error Handling in Async Code:** (As covered in section 1) Errors from async functions or promise rejections now propagate to your error handlers automatically ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=)). This makes building reliable APIs with async/await simpler and reduces chances of uncaught exceptions crashing the app.

- **`app.listen` Error Callback:** In Express 4, if the server failed to start (for example, the port was already in use), an `'error'` event would throw if unhandled. In Express 5, the `app.listen` method will call the provided callback with an error object if the server fails to bind/listen ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)). This means you can handle startup errors in one place. For example: 

  ```js
  // Express 5 example: handling listen errors
  app.listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Failed to start server:', err);
      process.exit(1);
    } else {
      console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
    }
  });
  ```

  In Express 4, the above callback would only run on successful start; an error like EADDRINUSE would be thrown and you'd need to handle it with `server.on('error', ...)` on the returned server object. Express 5 shifts this responsibility so you can catch it in the same callback, which aligns with typical Node.js callback error patterns ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)).

- **Default `req.body` Handling:** If no body parser is used or for requests where no body is expected, `req.body` was an empty object `{}` in Express 4. In Express 5, `req.body` will be `undefined` when no body is present ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=10.%20,default)). This subtle change helps distinguish “no body was sent” from “body was sent but empty object”, making it clearer when a body-parsing middleware hasn’t been applied. Be sure to check for `req.body` accordingly.

- **Read-only Query Params:** In Express 4, `req.query` (the parsed query string object) could be mutated by your code, which could lead to confusion or bugs. Express 5 makes `req.query` a read-only object ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=9.%20)). This means you can trust that `req.query` truly reflects the URL query parameters and isn’t accidentally modified elsewhere in middleware. Trying to assign to it will throw an error in strict mode. This change improves consistency and prevents accidental side effects.

- **Improved Default Views Rendering:** If you use server-side templates, Express’s `res.render()` is now consistently asynchronous for all view engines ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)). In Express 4, some template engines that rendered synchronously could cause subtle bugs. Express 5 enforces async behavior (likely by always deferring the callback), which makes rendering more reliable and non-blocking.

Together, these changes make Express 5 apps more robust. Handling of errors is more uniform and aligned with Node conventions, and the framework eliminates some footguns (like mutating query or assuming a body). For developers, this means fewer surprises in production and an easier debugging experience.

## 4. API Cleanup: Removed and Replaced Features from Express 4

Over the years, Express 4 had accumulated some deprecated methods and inconsistent API choices. Express 5 cleans up these legacy features, removing deprecated APIs or replacing them with clearer alternatives. When migrating from Express 4, you’ll want to update any usage of these old patterns. Here are the major removals and how to handle them in Express 5:

- **`app.del()` -> `app.delete()`:** The alias `app.del()` for defining DELETE routes is gone. Use `app.delete()` which is now safe to use (ES6 made `delete` an acceptable property name) ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)).  
  ```js
  // Express 4
  app.del('/resource/:id', deleteHandler);
  // Express 5
  app.delete('/resource/:id', deleteHandler);
  ```

- **`req.param(name)` Removed:** The method `req.param()` (which tried to retrieve a parameter from route params, body, or query) has been **fully removed** ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=for%20keeping%20your%20code%20compatible)). It was deprecated because it could be unclear about the data source. In Express 5, **explicitly use** `req.params`, `req.query`, or `req.body` as appropriate:
  ```js
  // Express 4 (deprecated)
  const id = req.param('id');  // might come from route or query string
  // Express 5
  const id = req.params.id;    // clearly from URL path
  // or const id = req.query.id; if from query string
  ```

- **`app.param(fn)` Removed:** Express 4 had a rarely-used feature `app.param(fn)` that would act as a catch-all param pre-processor. This is removed in Express 5 ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=used)). The more common usage `app.param('paramName', fn)` (for specific parameters) remains available, but developers are encouraged to simply use middleware for preprocessing route parameters. In practice, instead of:  
  ```js
  // Express 4 style param pre-processing
  app.param('userId', (req, res, next, id) => {
    // e.g., fetch User by id and attach to req
    req.user = findUserById(id);
    next();
  });
  app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => { ...req.user... });
  ```  
  You can do:  
  ```js
  // Express 5 recommended approach
  function loadUser(req, res, next) {
    const { userId } = req.params;
    req.user = findUserById(userId);
    next();
  }
  app.get('/users/:userId', loadUser, (req, res) => { ...req.user... });
  ```  
  This explicit middleware chaining makes it clear what is happening and when. It improves readability and debuggability, as noted by Express team members ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=In%20express4%20app,which%20would%20be%20needed%20later)) ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=In%20express5%20this%20has%20been,clear%20and%20easy%20to%20debug)).

- **Res Response Method Signature Changes:** A number of `response` methods that had alternate calling signatures have been removed for consistency. Express 5 generally prefers using **explicit methods for status codes** instead of overloading method parameters ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,res.status%28status%29.json%28obj)):
  - `res.send(status)` (with only a status code) is removed – use `res.sendStatus(status)` for sending just a status code response ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=7.%20)).
  - `res.send(body, status)` or `res.send(status, body)` are removed – use the chainable syntax: `res.status(status).send(body)` ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=8.%20)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,signatures%3A%20Use)).
  - Similarly, `res.json(obj, status)` or reversed are removed – use `res.status(status).json(obj)`.
  - `res.redirect(url, status)` (old signature) is replaced by `res.redirect(status, url)` – i.e. swap the arguments to put status first if you need to set a status code ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,Instead%2C%20access%20parameters)). (This avoids confusion over parameter order.)
  - The special case `res.redirect('back')` (and `res.location('back')`) which sent users back to the referrer is no longer built-in. You should implement this yourself if needed: e.g. `res.redirect(req.get('Referer') || '/')` ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,signatures%3A%20Use)).
  - `res.sendfile()` (lowercase 'f') is removed. Use the proper camelCase `res.sendFile()` method introduced in Express 4 for serving files ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,instead)).

  These changes make the API surface more logical. In Express 4, having multiple ways to call the same method could lead to mistakes (for example, passing arguments in the wrong order). Express 5 now has one clear way to do each task, which improves code clarity.

- **Pluralization of Accepts Methods:** Methods like `req.acceptsCharset`, `req.acceptsLanguage`, and `req.acceptsEncoding` are now pluralized (`req.acceptsCharsets()`, etc.) for consistency ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=3,for%20keeping%20your%20code%20compatible)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,instead)). This is a minor change – just update the method names if you use them.

In summary, Express 5 removes a lot of historical cruft. Many of these were deprecated in Express 4, so your app might already avoid them. If not, the migration involves straightforward find-and-replace updates. The benefit is a cleaner framework – one that’s easier to learn (fewer confusing methods) and less prone to developer error. As the official announcement states, these removals make the API “more predictable and easier to use” by streamlining it ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,instead)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=As%20a%20framework%2C%20we%20aim,to%20use%20a%20single%2C%20consistent)).

## 5. Other Improvements and New Features

Beyond the headline items above, Express 5 comes with various smaller improvements and updates that bolster performance and modern development practices:

- **Built-in Middleware Updates:** Express 5 continues to include built-in body-parsing middleware (`express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`), which means you don’t need the external **body-parser** package for JSON and URL-encoded form bodies (this was already true in later Express 4.x versions). Notably, the `express.urlencoded()` parser’s `extended` option now defaults to `false` (so it will not parse nested objects by default) ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,for%20Brotli%20lossless%20data%20compression)). If your app relied on extended parsing of URL-encoded data, you may need to set `extended: true` manually in Express 5. Also, the old combined `bodyParser()` middleware (deprecated in 4.x) has been removed entirely ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=,for%20Brotli%20lossless%20data%20compression)).

- **Brotli Compression Support:** Express 5 adds support for Brotli compression. If you use compression middleware (`compression` package) or serve static files, Express 5 can now negotiate Brotli encoding (`br`) with clients that support it ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=violated%20the%20recommended%20interface)). Brotli often provides better compression ratios than gzip, meaning faster load times for clients. This upgrade is mostly behind-the-scenes, but it’s a performance gain out-of-the-box when serving text-based assets.

- **Modern JavaScript and ES Module Support:** Since Express 5 requires Node.js 18+, it allows developers to use modern JavaScript features confidently. The Express codebase itself benefits from newer JS syntax and improvements (leading to potential internal performance optimizations ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=Express,js%20projects))). For your apps, this also means you can use Express 5 in an ECMAScript Module (ESM) project easily. You can now `import express from 'express'` in Node, instead of being forced to use CommonJS require, which aligns with the direction of Node’s evolution ([Express 5 is here, what’s new? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ujjwal_kr_gupta/express-5-is-here-whats-new-4lfk#:~:text=1)). This makes Express more convenient to integrate in modern toolchains and with frontend build systems that prefer ESM.

- **Performance and Security:** By dropping support for very old Node versions, Express 5 was able to remove outdated dependencies and address long-standing issues. The update to the routing engine (mentioned earlier) was in part to eliminate a whole class of Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerabilities in route definitions ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=This%20release%20no%20longer%20supports,hook%20for%20such%20security%20aspects)). Additionally, using the latest V8 and Node.js features can yield speed improvements. The maintainers have indicated v5 includes optimizations and cleaner internals aimed at better performance ([What's New in Express.js v5.0](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/whats-new-in-express-5#:~:text=request%20was%20opened%20in%20July,js%20projects)). While Express 5 is still the familiar Express (no drastic rewrites), you might notice slight improvements in throughput or memory usage thanks to these updates.

- **Community and Maintenance:** Although not a technical feature, it’s worth noting that Express 5 marks that the framework is actively maintained again with modern best practices. Upgrading ensures you continue to receive important security patches and community support, whereas Express 4 will eventually go into maintenance/LTS only ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=We%20recognize%20that%20this%20might,versions%20as%20soon%20as%20possible)). Express 5 also provides codemods (automated transforms) to assist in upgrades ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=Express%205%20Codemods)) – useful for large codebases.

## Code Migration Summary

To tie everything together, here’s a quick **cheat-sheet of Express 4 to Express 5 changes** with examples:

- **Async Handlers:** Remove try/catch and let Express 5 handle async errors.  
  *Old:* `app.get('/x', async (req,res,next)=>{ try{...} catch(e){ next(e) } });`  
  *New:* `app.get('/x', async (req,res)=>{ ... }); // errors auto-forward`

- **Route Parameters:** Update route strings for wildcards and optional params.  
  *Old:* `app.use('/api/*', ...)` → *New:* `app.use('/api/*splat', ...)`  
  *Old:* `app.get('/user/:id?', ...)` → *New:* `app.get('/user{:id}', ...)`

- **Removed Methods:** Replace or refactor deprecated APIs.  
  *Old:* `app.del('/path', ...)` → *New:* `app.delete('/path', ...)`  
  *Old:* `req.param('name')` → *New:* `req.params.name` (or `req.query.name`)  
  *Old:* `res.sendStatus(200, body)` → *New:* `res.status(200).send(body)`  
  *Old:* `res.send(500)` → *New:* `res.sendStatus(500)`  
  *Old:* `res.redirect('back')` → *New:* `res.redirect(req.get('Referer') || '/')`

- **Middleware Changes:**  
  *Old:* `req.query.someProp = 'x'` (possible in v4) → *New:* avoid mutating `req.query` (read-only in v5).  
  *Old:* Assuming `req.body` is always an object → *New:* check `if (req.body) { ... }` since it might be undefined when no body is sent.

- **ESM Import (if applicable):**  
  *Old:* `const express = require('express');`  
  *New:* `import express from 'express';` (when using Node ESM).

By updating your code as above, you can migrate to Express 5 and enjoy its improvements. Be sure to run your test suite after upgrading – Express 5’s changes, while mostly minor, can cause runtime errors if some outdated usage is left in place. The official migration guide provides a detailed list of breaking changes to double-check ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=Changes%20in%20Express%205)) ([Introducing Express v5: A New Era for the Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html#:~:text=carried%20over%20from%20v3,changes%20you%20need%20to%20make)).

## Conclusion

Express.js 5 brings a host of advantages over Express 4, especially in terms of developer experience and cleaner code. With native async/await support, you can write more linear and bug-resistant asynchronous code. The refined routing syntax makes your route definitions clearer and safer. Deprecations from the past have been cleaned up, leading to a more consistent API surface. Under the hood, Express is now aligned with modern Node.js, potentially yielding performance gains and definitely making future maintenance easier.

Upgrading to Express 5 is a logical step for long-term projects – it modernizes your application and prepares it for the future. The changes are mostly straightforward (as we illustrated with code examples), and the Express team has provided tools (like codemods and guides) to assist in the migration ([Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html#:~:text=Express%205%20Codemods)). By adopting Express 5, you ensure your Node.js web applications remain **robust, readable, and up-to-date** with the latest practices in the Node ecosystem.

Finally, remember that while Express 5 is a major version, it retains the spirit of Express – minimalistic and unopinionated. All your knowledge of Express 4 carries over, with just a few new tricks and best practices to learn. Happy coding with Express 5! 🚀
