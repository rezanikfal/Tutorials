### props immutability :
- It ensures that components don't change their props. Change comes from Parent.
- React is designed around the concept of one-way data flow. Data (props) flows down from parent.
- Component remains isolated and more reusable.
- Immutable props allow React to quickly determine if a component needs to re-render.
## React Project Structure

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>
}
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```
