# AI Engineer / Applied AI Developer Roadmap

## Phase 1: Python & Engineering Foundations (Weeks 1–3)

**Goal:** Write clean, confident Python and understand project structure.

### Core Skills

* Data structures: list, dict, set, tuple
* Functions & modules
* Virtual environments (venv)
* Imports & packages
* Error handling & debugging
* `collections` module
* File I/O (CSV, JSON)

### Practice

* Write small scripts without tutorials
* Refactor old exercises
* Read stack traces until they make sense

**Deliverable:**

* A small multi-file Python project with clear structure

---

## Phase 2: Data Handling & Thinking (Weeks 4–5)

**Goal:** Become comfortable working with real-world data.

### Tools

* `numpy`
* `pandas`

### Concepts

* Data cleaning
* Filtering & aggregation
* Feature extraction

### Mini Projects

* CSV → clean → analyze → export
* Log or text data processing

**Deliverable:**

* Data processing script + README

---

## Phase 3: Practical Machine Learning (Weeks 6–7)

**Goal:** Understand the ML workflow without heavy math.

### Tools

* `scikit-learn`

### Concepts

* Features vs labels
* Train/test split
* Fit / predict
* Evaluation metrics
* Overfitting (conceptual)

### Mini Project

* Simple classifier or regressor

**Deliverable:**

* End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → evaluation)

---

## Phase 4: LLMs & Modern AI Systems (Weeks 8–10)

**Goal:** Build AI features using large language models.

### Concepts

* Prompt design
* Embeddings
* Vector databases
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* Tool / function calling

### Projects

* Chat with documents
* AI-powered FAQ
* Search over PDFs or notes

**Deliverable:**

---

## Phase 5: Deployment & Production (Weeks 11–12)

**Goal:** Turn AI code into a real service.

### Tools

* FastAPI
* Background tasks
* Basic authentication
* Rate limiting (conceptual)

### Concepts

* Latency
* Cost control
* Logging & monitoring

**Deliverable:**

* AI service with API endpoints

---

## Phase 6: Portfolio & Career Signal (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Look employable as an AI Engineer.

### Focus
