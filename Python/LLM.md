## The CO-STAR Framework

The **CO-STAR Framework** is a simple structure for writing clear, effective prompts or messages, especially when working with AI or communicating complex requests.

### **C — Context**

Background information needed to understand the situation.
What’s going on? What should the responder know first?
**Example:** You are helping me write documentation for a Python project.

### **O — Objective**

The specific goal or outcome you want.
What do you want done?
**Example:** Explain virtual environments in simple terms.

### **S — Style**

How the response should be structured or written.
Formal, bullet points, step-by-step, short, technical, etc.
**Example:** Use short bullet points.

### **T — Tone**

The emotional or conversational feel.
Friendly, professional, beginner-friendly, confident, neutral.
**Example:** Keep it beginner-friendly.

### **A — Audience**

Who the response is for.
Beginner, expert, developer, manager, non-technical user.
**Example:** For someone new to Python.

### **R — Response**

The expected format or output.
Paragraph, code snippet, checklist, summary, example.
**Example:** End with a short example.

### Example with labels (learning mode)

```
Context: I’m learning Python in VSCode
Objective: Explain virtual environments
Style: Short and clear
Tone: Beginner-friendly
Audience: New Python devs
Response: Bullet points + example
```

### Same prompt without labels (real-world use)

```
I’m learning Python in VSCode. Explain what a virtual environment is
in a short, beginner-friendly way, using bullet points and one example.
```
