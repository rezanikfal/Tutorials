# Agile Mindset
- It might be more efficient to have generalists instead of specialists.
- It also might make sense to focus on short-term planning.
### Managing people in a factory VS in a software project
- You can't direct a team of people who collectively know more about the product than anyone else in management.
- So you have managers becoming less directive and more supportive. 
- One of the key things that you see with agile teams is this push to be self organized
- You focus on having collective decision making.
### Traditional Planning
1. Plan the project
2. Execute the project
3. Test the project
### Agile Mindset
 - Balance between making decisions and having enough flexibility to make changes
 - Most software products have to deal with something called the cone of uncertainty.
